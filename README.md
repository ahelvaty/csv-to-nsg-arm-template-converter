# csv-to-nsg-arm-template-converter
This program converts a CSV or Excel file to a Network Security Group (NSG) Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template.

The original program was written without real functions - just lines and lines of script-like code. I know... that's bad. The rewrite is in progress, but slow-going as this program is rarely used now.
